The Focus Walk is an essential part of our daily operations, designed to ensure that team members stay informed and aligned with the latest updates, announcements, and changes within the organization. By dedicating an hour each day to reading Confluence and Issue updates, team members can stay connected with important information that impacts their work and the overall project. This practice not only enhances communication and transparency but also helps in identifying and addressing any potential issues or blockers promptly. 

## Daily Tasks

### Sprint and Issue Management:

- [ ] 1.  Log in to Jira and review the current sprint. Ensure each team member has their issue in one of the following status columns: Design, Research, Optimize, Implement, or Deploy. Address any deviations from this guideline.
